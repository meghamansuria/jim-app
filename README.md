# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

Installs required packages.


## [Front End](/client)
### `yarn install`
### `cd client`
The way that this works is that in the front-end, you'll need to cd into client, and then do the following commands:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## [Back End](/server)
For backend, navigate to server, and then do the following commands in a separate terminal from front end:
### `yarn install`
### `cd server`
The way that this works is that in the back-end, you'll need to cd into server, and then do the following commands:
### `yarn start`

## Some of Jim's Dependencies
### Material UI
Material UI creates react components for faster and easier web development. We use this to help design our system and so that we have beautiful designs that help enhance our website and make it more user-friendly.
### React Testing Library
The React Testing Library builds on top of the DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components. This library encouranges your applications ot be more accessible and allows us to get our tests closer to using our components the way a user would. 
### Axios
Just like in our other assignments in class, we use axios which is a promise based HTTP client for the browser. This helps us send asynchronous HTTP requests to endpoints and we use it with React. 
### Formix
Formix is a small group of React componest and hooks that help us build our forms in React. This helps with validation and error messages, handling form submission, and getting values in and out of the form state. 
### Lodash
Lodash makes javasript easier by taking out the hassle when working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. We use it to iterate through arrays, objects and strings, and manipulate and test values.
### Moment
Just like in our class labs, we use moment. 
### TypeScript
TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on top of JavaScript by adding static type definitions. We use this to transform our javascript code and make formatting every page beautifully.
