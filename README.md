## [Front End](/client)
The way that this works is that in front-end, you'll need to cd into client, and then do the following commands:
### yarn install
### yarn start
The first will install all necessary requirements to run our frontend on local host and then start will open up on localhost.

## [Back End](/server)
For backend, navigate to server, and then do the following commands in a separate terminal from front end:
### yarn install
### yarn start
The first will install all necessary dependencies to run our backend on local host and the second will start the backend.
